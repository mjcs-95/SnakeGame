# SnakeGame
The classic Snake, done in Java.

Coding this I learnt to use keybindings in Java instead of keylisteners

# Controls
The code use the arrow keys of the keyboard to change direction.

# Future Works
Add a pause Button.

Add a defeat Screen.

Correct a bug caused if change of direction too fast 180 degrees(e.g: left+up when going down), making the snake to eat herself without drawing the move.
