# SnakeGame
The classic Snake, done in Java.

Coding this I learnt to use keybindings in Java instead of keylisteners

The class SnakeGameRules have all the logic of the game

The class SnakeGameApp have all the GUI and the structure of the game in the function play().

# Controls
The code use the arrow keys of the keyboard to change direction.

# Future Works
Add a pause Button.

Add a defeat Screen.

Correct a bug caused if change of direction too fast 180 degrees(e.g: left+up when going down), making the snake to eat herself without drawing the move.
